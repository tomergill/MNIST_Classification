How to run the MNIST classifiers:
    python MNIST-classifier.py [type max_depth [folds num_boosts]] [location]
Where [] are optional depending on type.

If type is "dt" then a decision tree classification is being used (sklearn's DecisionTreeLearner) and the max_depth
    parameter needs to be set, but folds and num_boosts are *not*.

If type is either "cv" or "boosting" then xgboost's cross validation function will be used,
    and all of max_dpeth, folds and num_boosts needs to be set.

If type is not supplied then the XGBClassifier is used and no other parameter needs to be set.

For all types the last parameter location is optional, and is the path to the training and test data sets.
If no location is specified then the current folder is used.
NOTICE: The program looks for the files: t10k-images-idx3-ubyte, t10k-labels-idx3-ubyte, train-images-idx3-ubyte and
    train-labels-idx3-ubyte. So they need to be in location.
